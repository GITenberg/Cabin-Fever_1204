description: The prolific author Bertha Muzzy Bower lived on a number of Western ranches
  and farms in her day and was intimately acquainted with the creeping solitude that
  can surround those who spend time alone on the range. In Cabin Fever, Bower weaves
  a subtle psychological thriller into the familiar Western landscape that serves
  as the setting for her most acclaimed works.
